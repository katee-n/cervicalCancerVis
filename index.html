    <h1>Cervical Cancer Visualizations</h1>
    <h2>Scrollytelling of Cervical Cancer Risk Factors. Filterable by age.</h2>
    <div class="div-text">
      <p>The dataset <strong>“Cervical Cancer VS Demographic, Habits, MedHistory” </strong>contains information about
        858 different
        patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and factors that may have caused this disease.
        The dataset was collected at <strong>'Hospital Universitario de Caracas'</strong> in Caracas, Venezuela and
        should emphasize the
        necessity of preventive measures regarding cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>We decided to use this dataset because cervical cancer isn’t discussed as much as we think it should. It
        affects lots of people, although it could be <strong>prevented or diagnosed</strong> earlier more often. Even in
        Austria,
        especially young people, aren’t informed as much about this disease and its causes, preventions and symptoms.

        visualiations.</p>

        <h2>Agerange of patients</h2>
        <p>The following chart represents the <strong>age</strong> of the participants of the study.</p>
        <p>
          The interesting thing about our data set is that there are patients in a wide variety of age groups. <br>
          This allows us to let the viewer of the visualization explore for himself at which age which risk factors are more
          prominent and from which age the risk for cervical cancer generally rises and falls.</p>

        <h2>Riskfactors</h2>
        <p>The wordcloud illustrates the major <strong>risk factors</strong> associated with cervical cancer 
          - smoking, IUDs, STIs, birth control pills, and multiple sexual partners.</p>
        <p>
          The more prominent - or rather bigger - a word is, the greater 
          its impact as a risk factor for cervical cancer. <br>
          This is due to the fact that more participants - who were diagnosed with 
          cervical cancer - are or were exposed to the risk factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through hovering above one of the words a tooltip appears with the exact number of people.

        <p>These two circles show the amount of people who <strong>did do checkups</strong> vs the people who 
          <strong>didn't do checkups</strong>. As these exams can help with detecting cervical cancer quite early, 
          we think it is important to emphasize the contrast in size between these two groups.</p>

        <h2>Checkups distribution</h2>
        <p>The donut chart is an extension of the one pie chart above, which represents 
          the number of examinations performed before the participants got their diagnosis.<br>
          The donut chart is intended to give deeper insight into <strong>which</strong> of the <strong>four examinations</strong>
          was done <strong>how often</strong>. </p>
        <p>
          An examination for cervical cancer includes cytological screening, biopsy and 
          colposcopy. The latter consists of four stages, the last two of which are the 
          Hinselmann and Schiller tests. <br>
          All four check-up types are represented here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through hovering above one of the sections in the donut chart a tooltip will appear 
          that shows the exact number of people who did the certain examination.
